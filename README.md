# Percayso Programming Exercise 3

**Please see [my deployed website](https://suzinewswebsite.vercel.app/)**

## Notes
 
- The deployment is from a fork of this repo as I am on the free tier of vercel so cannot deploy from an organisation.
- I had hoped to create a multi-page website where each card links to a page for that article - however I ran out of time and the benefits to the user of reading the article on my website rather than the author's site are not that big. Whilst the use of Next is a bit redundant given this is now a single-page site, at least it improves SEO and helped me grow my own knowledge of Next!
- I am glad I was able to get the site mostly responsive for mobile, and I was grateful to my past self for creating the wireframes and react component tree at the beginning!
